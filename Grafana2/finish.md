## Conclusion
This tutorial shows you the importance of dashboards. It also lists two common types of database attacks and how to use dashboards to monitor both of them.

In addition, you are free to create different panels to monitor the corresponding information. You can not only detect the situation as soon as possible, but also prevent it from happening and minimize the damage.

Additional Information:
If you want to know whether the operation is executed internally or externally, you can add a new condition to where, restricting user_host like "%'%'%" If it is an internal user, user_host will be local_host, and the opposite will be %. It is very helpful in investigating the source of the attack.
